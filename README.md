**Vehicle Detection**

The steps of this project are the following:

* Using an appropriate color domain representation, perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier.
* Supplement these features with binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to the HOG feature vector. 
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use the trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run the pipeline on a video stream. Use heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
